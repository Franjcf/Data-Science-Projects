   173	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0
   174	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!	0
   175	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	0

   190	what a disappointment	0
   191	don't waste your money and time.	0
   192	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	0

   194	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0
   195	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0

   199	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.	0
   200	Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
   201	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.	0
   202	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.	0
   203	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	0
   204	Low Quality.	0
   205	Warning - Stay away.	0
   206	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	0
   207	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0
   208	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	0
   209	Very Displeased.	0
   210	I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0
   211	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	0
   212	Does not fit.	0
   213	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	0

   226	Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.	0
   227	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	0
   228	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.	0
   229	I'd like to return it.	0
   230	Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0
   231	A Disappointment.	0
   232	Its not user friendly.	0
   233	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
   234	Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0
   235	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0
   236	Pretty piece of junk.	0
   237	Plug was the wrong size.	0
   238	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0

   243	I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
   244	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0
   245	As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0

   247	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0

   249	REALLY UGLY.	0
   250	horrible, had to switch 3 times.	0
   251	No real improvement.	0
   252	They refuse to refund or replace.	0
   253	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	0
   254	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
   255	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0
   256	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0
   257	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	0
   258	Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0
   259	Don't buy this product.	0
   260	sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	0
   261	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0
   262	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
   263	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0
   264	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
   265	It's AGGRAVATING!	0
   266	None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
   267	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0
   268	Please dont waste your money.	0
   269	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0
   270	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	0
   271	Disapointing Results.	0
   272	Cumbersome design.	0
   273	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	0
   274	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0
   275	Worst ever.	0
   276	I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	0
   277	The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0
   278	That company is a joke.	0
   279	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	0
   280	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	0
   281	Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.	0
   282	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
   283	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0
   284	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0
   285	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
   286	Sprint - terrible customer service.	0
   287	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	0
   288	Piece of trash.	0
   289	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0
   290	Poor Construction.	0
   291	This is infuriating.	0
   292	Sprint charges for this service.	0
   293	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0
   294	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
   295	the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.	0
   296	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0
   297	Poor product.	0
   298	However I needed some better instructions.	0
   299	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0
   300	Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0
   301	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0
   302	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0
   303	Very Dissapointing Performance.	0
   304	Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0
   305	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	0
   306	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0
   307	Don't bother - go to the store.	0
   308	You get what you pay for I guess.	0
   309	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0
   310	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	0
   311	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0
   312	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0
   313	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	0
   314	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0
   315	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0
   316	Battery is terrible.	0
   317	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	0
   318	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0
   319	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	0
   320	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0
   321	Talk about USELESS customer service.	0
   322	It felt too light and "tinny.".	0
   323	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
   324	I could not recommend these more.	0
   325	Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	0
   326	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
   327	A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.	0
   328	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
   329	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0
   330	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0
   331	Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	0
   332	Truly awful.	0
   333	And none of the tones is acceptable.	0
   334	camera color balance is AWFUL.	0
   335	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0

   698	This fixes all the problems.	1
   699	I am very happy	1
   700	I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	1
   701	It does everything the description said it would.	1
   702	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1
   703	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
   704	Better than expected.	1
   705	Battery is holding up well.	1
   706	Linked to my phone without effort.	1
   707	THey are so cool!	1
   708	Easy to use.	1
   709	Better Than New.	1
   710	A pretty good product.	1
   711	This is a great phone!.	1
   712	For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	1
   713	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
   714	Those phones are working just fine now.	1
   715	I am more than happy with this product.	1
   716	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1
   717	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	1
   718	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
   719	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1
   720	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1
   721	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1
   722	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
   723	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
   724	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
   725	I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	1
   726	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	1
   727	Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1
   728	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1
   729	These are fabulous!	1
   730	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
   731	Very wind-resistant.	1
   732	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1
   733	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1
   734	Great phone.	1
   735	I'm pleased.	1
   736	I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	1
   737	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
   738	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
   739	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	1
   740	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	1
   741	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
   742	Does everything it should and more.	1
   743	Nice Sound.	1
   744	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1
   745	Setup went very smoothly.	1
   746	It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1
   747	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	1
   748	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
   749	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	1
   750	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	1
   751	Works well.	1
   752	Clear crisp sound.	1
   753	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1
   754	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1
   755	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1
   756	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
   757	You can't beat the price on these.	1
   758	* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1
   759	lightweight and works well.	1
   760	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1
   761	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1
   762	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
   763	jabra ear gels "R" the best!.	1
   764	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1
   765	It was a great phone.	1
   766	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1
   767	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
   768	This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	1
   769	In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?	1
   770	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1
   771	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
   772	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1
   773	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
   774	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1
   775	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	1
   776	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
   777	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1
   778	Krussel Always good.	1
   779	The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	1
   780	The design is very good.4.	1
   781	I great reception all the time.	1
   782	I would highly recommend this product.	1
   783	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is	1
   784	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.	1
   785	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1
   786	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1
   787	Blue Ant is easy to use.	1
   788	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	1
   789	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	1
   790	The sound quality is excellent as well.	1
   791	Its the best headset I have used.	1
   792	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	1
   793	Just what I wanted.	1
   794	Great product.	1
   795	Crisp and Clear.	1
   796	The reception has been generally good.	1
   797	Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	1
   798	Great bluetooth!.	1
   799	I highly recommend this case.	1
   800	WORTHWHILE.	1
   801	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
   802	Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
   803	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0
   804	Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
   805	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0
   806	Wasted two hours.  	0
   807	A bit predictable.  	0
   808	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0
   809	This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
   810	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
   811	Today the graphics are crap.  	0
   812	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
   813	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
   814	I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
   815	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
   816	But it's just not funny.  	0
   817	But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
   818	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
   819	The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
   820	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
   821	But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
   822	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
   823	Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
   824	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
   825	I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
   826	One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
   827	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
   828	There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
   829	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
   830	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
   831	And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
   832	Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
   833	It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
   834	I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
   835	I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  	0
   836	The problem was the script.  	0
   837	It was horrendous.  	0
   838	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
   839	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	0
   840	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
   841	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0
   842	It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0
   843	Too politically correct.  	0
   844	Very disappointing.  	0
   845	I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	0
   846	An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0
   847	The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0
   848	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0
   849	), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  	0
   850	The directing seems too pretentious.  	0
   851	The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  	0
   852	And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0
   853	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
   854	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
   855	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
   856	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
   857	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
   858	This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0
   859	All in all, a great disappointment.  	0
   860	I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  	0
   861	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
   862	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0
   863	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
   864	I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	0
   865	Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
   866	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	0
   867	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0
   868	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0
   869	You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
   870	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
   871	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  	0
   872	A truly, truly bad film.  	0
   873	The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	0
   874	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  	0
   875	I paid too much.  	0
   876	It was so BORING!  	0
   877	No plot whatsoever!  	0
   878	Again, no plot at all.  	0
   879	Horrible!  	0
   880	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
   881	I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  	0
   882	I hate movies like that.  	0
   883	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	0
   884	THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  	0
   885	If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	0
   886	Awful.  	0
   887	I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	0
   888	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	0
   889	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0
   890	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0
   891	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0
   892	Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	0
   893	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	0
   894	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	0
   895	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0
   896	I mean this in a terrible way.  	0
   897	This film has no redeeming features.  	0
   898	Everything is appalling.  	0
   899	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	0
   900	The story is beyond stupid.  	0
   901	The script iswas there a script?  	0
   902	The kids are annoying.  	0
   903	The lead man is charisma-free.  	0
   904	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0
   905	I'll even say it again  this is torture.  	0
   906	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0
   907	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
   908	Highly unrecommended.  	0
   909	If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  	0
   910	Yes, it's that bad.  	0
   911	Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
   912	This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  	0
   913	There were too many close ups.  	0
   914	But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	0
   915	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0
   916	This movie is BAD.  	0
   917	So bad.  	0
   918	The film is way too long.  	0
   919	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
   920	I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
   921	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
   922	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
   923	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
   924	Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
   925	It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
   926	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
   927	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
   928	There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
   929	Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
   930	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
   931	The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
   932	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
   933	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
   934	Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
   935	However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
   936	I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
   937	The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
   938	Woa, talk about awful.  	0
   939	Do not waste your time.  	0
   940	It was just too horrible.  	0
   941	The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
   942	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
   943	The poor actors.  	0
   944	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
   945	If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
   946	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
   947	Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
   948	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
   949	No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
   950	Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
   951	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
   952	The dialogue sucked.  	0
   953	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
   954	The soundtrack sucked.  	0
   955	The acting sucked.  	0
   956	The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
   957	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
   958	But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
   959	I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
   960	I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
   961	If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
   962	It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
   963	Again, lame.  	0
   964	Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
   965	And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
   966	When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
   967	Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
   968	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
   969	The acting was bad.  	0
   970	Really bad.  	0
   971	Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
   972	Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
   973	Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
   974	I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
   975	I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
   976	But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	0
   977	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0
   978	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	0
   979	Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
   980	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
   981	This movie is terrible.  	0
   982	The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
   983	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
   984	To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
   985	Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0

  1024	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0
  1025	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0
  1026	Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0

  1031	1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	0
  1032	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
  1033	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
  1034	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0

  1060	I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	0
  1061	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0
  1062	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
  1063	The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
  1064	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
  1065	Of course, the acting is blah.  	0
  1066	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0

  1209	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1

  1211	It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  	1
  1212	" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
  1213	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
  1214	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
  1215	How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
  1216	It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1

  1253	The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1
  1254	It is a true classic.  	1
  1255	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
  1256	Definitely worth checking out.  	1
  1257	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1
  1258	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1
  1259	The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1
  1260	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
  1261	If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	1
  1262	I don't think you will be disappointed.  	1
  1263	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
  1264	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
  1265	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1
  1266	Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	1
  1267	I really liked that.  	1
  1268	A great film by a great director.  	1
  1269	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1
  1270	The music in the film is really nice too.  	1
  1271	I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
  1272	Brilliant!  	1
  1273	10/10  	1
  1274	I liked this movie way too much.  	1
  1275	It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1
  1276	This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1
  1277	Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  	1
  1278	Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1
  1279	An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
  1280	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1
  1281	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
  1282	"You'll love it!  	1
  1283	The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
  1284	John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
  1285	His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
  1286	I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
  1287	Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
  1288	His performance is simply genius.  	1
  1289	He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  	1
  1290	" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
  1291	Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
  1292	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
  1293	Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
  1294	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
  1295	When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
  1296	I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
  1297	If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
  1298	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
  1299	Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
  1300	That was nice.  	1
  1301	That was funny.  	1
  1302	It was so funny.  	1
  1303	***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
  1304	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
  1305	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
  1306	And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
  1307	All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
  1308	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
  1309	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
  1310	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
  1311	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
  1312	It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
  1313	Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
  1314	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
  1315	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
  1316	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
  1317	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
  1318	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
  1319	There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
  1320	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
  1321	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
  1322	He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
  1323	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
  1324	Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
  1325	And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
  1326	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
  1327	I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
  1328	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
  1329	10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
  1330	I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
  1331	his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
  1332	the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
  1333	In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
  1334	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
  1335	This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
  1336	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
  1337	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
  1338	So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
  1339	It even has its sweet moments.  	1
  1340	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	1
  1341	All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	1
  1342	And I really did find them funny.  	1
  1343	This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
  1344	There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1
  1345	" I love it.  	1
  1346	The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
  1347	I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
  1348	I will never forget it now.  	1
  1349	It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
  1350	It is a really good show to watch.  	1
  1351	It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
  1352	Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
  1353	is pretty funny.  	1
  1354	Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
  1355	The kids are very cool too.  	1
  1356	I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  	1
  1357	The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  	1
  1358	I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
  1359	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1
  1360	I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  	1
  1361	I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
  1362	The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	1
  1363	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  	1
  1364	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
  1365	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
  1366	Definitely worth checking out.  	1
  1367	Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
  1368	This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	1
  1369	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
  1370	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	1
  1371	This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
  1372	I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
  1373	I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  	1
  1374	The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1
  1375	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1
  1376	The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	1
  1377	After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  	1
  1378	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
  1379	Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
  1380	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	1
  1381	Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	1
  1382	This is high adventure at its best.  	1
  1383	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
  1384	Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1
  1385	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
  1386	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	1
  1387	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	1
  1388	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
  1389	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	1
  1390	It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  	1
  1391	It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  	1
  1392	It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  	1
  1393	I rather enjoyed it.  	1
  1394	I liked it.  	1
  1395	It really created a unique feeling though.  	1
  1396	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
  1397	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
  1398	Her role was played well.  	1
  1399	Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1
  1400	The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1
  1401	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
  1402	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	1
  1403	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
  1404	I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  	1
  1405	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
  1406	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1
  1407	Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	1
  1408	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1
  1409	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	1
  1410	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
  1411	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
  1412	My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	1
  1413	I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  	1
  1414	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	1
  1415	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
  1416	I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1
  1417	I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	1
  1418	This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1
  1419	This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
  1420	Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
  1421	Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1
  1422	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1
  1423	This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	1
  1424	But this movie really got to me.  	1
  1425	See it.  	1
  1426	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	1
  1427	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
  1428	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1
  1429	I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  	1
  1430	Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	1
  1431	Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
  1432	The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
  1433	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1
  1434	Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  	1
  1435	The rest of the cast also play well.  	1
  1436	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
  1437	The cast is good.  	1
  1438	For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
  1439	the cast was great.  	1
  1440	steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  	1
  1441	add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1
  1442	STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	1
  1443	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
  1444	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
  1445	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
  1446	It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  	1
  1447	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
  1448	The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1
  1449	John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  	1
  1450	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	1
  1451	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1
  1452	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
  1453	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
  1454	But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  	1
  1455	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
  1456	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
  1457	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
  1458	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
  1459	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
  1460	I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  	1
  1461	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	1
  1462	Go watch it!  	1
  1463	VERY funny!  	1
  1464	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	1
  1465	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1
  1466	Don't miss it.  	1
  1467	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
  1468	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
  1469	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
  1470	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
  1471	I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
  1472	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1
  1473	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
  1474	I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
  1475	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1
  1476	I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	1
  1477	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
  1478	Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1
  1479	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
  1480	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
  1481	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1
  1482	But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1
  1483	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
  1484	There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
  1485	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
  1486	Overall, a delight!  	1
  1487	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1
  1488	I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  	1
  1489	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
  1490	The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  	1
  1491	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
  1492	Excellent performance.  	1
  1493	There still are good actors around!  	1
  1494	Also great directing and photography.  	1
  1495	Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	1
  1496	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
  1497	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
  1498	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
  1499	This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1
  1500	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	1
  1501	However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	1
  1502	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
  1503	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
  1504	This is a stunning movie.  	1
  1505	Raw and sublimely moving.  	1
  1506	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
  1507	All of the main players are mesmerising.  	1
  1508	Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	1
  1509	Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	1
  1510	He's a national treasure.  	1
  1511	GO AND SEE IT!  	1
  1512	This is an excellent film.  	1
  1513	The aerial scenes were well-done.  	1
  1514	It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
  1515	The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  	1
  1516	Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1
  1517	A good film by a great director!  	1
  1518	This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
  1519	This is just a great movie.  	1
  1520	10 out of 10 stars.  	1
  1521	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1
  1522	Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  	1
  1523	This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	1
  1524	I advise you to look out for it.  	1
  1525	You wont regret it!  	1
  1526	Highly recommended A+  	1
  1527	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1
  1528	The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
  1529	The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1
  1530	The transfers are very good.  	1
  1531	Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	1
  1532	The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	1
  1533	) some great music, and terrific scenery.  	1
  1534	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	1
  1535	) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
  1536	The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  	1
  1537	It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1
  1538	I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
  1539	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1
  1540	A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
  1541	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
  1542	Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1
  1543	Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1
  1544	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
  1545	Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  	1
  1546	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
  1547	I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1
  1548	But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
  1549	Meredith M was better than all right.  	1
  1550	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
  1551	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
  1552	Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  	1
  1553	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
  1554	This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  	1
  1555	A standout scene.  	1
  1556	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
  1557	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
  1558	The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	1
  1559	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1
  1560	This movie is also revealing.  	1
  1561	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	1
  1562	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
  1563	It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
  1564	An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	1
  1565	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
  1566	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1
  1567	The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	1
  1568	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
  1569	You won't forget this movie!  	1
  1570	I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  	1
  1571	But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  	1
  1572	This movie is so awesome!  	1
  1573	I loved it, it was really scary.  	1
  1574	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1
  1575	If you want a real scare rent this one!  	1
  1576	10/10  	1
  1577	This is an extraordinary film.  	1
  1578	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1
  1579	This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
  1580	The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
  1581	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
  1582	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
  1583	It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1
  1584	She carries the movie well.  	1
  1585	Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	1
  1586	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
  1587	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
  1588	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
  1589	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
  1590	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1
  1591	This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
  1592	When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  	1
  1593	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
  1594	You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
  1595	But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1
  1596	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
  1597	You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
  1598	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1
  1599	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
  1600	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
  1601	Crust is not good.	0
  1602	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
  1603	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
  1604	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
  1605	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
  1606	Would not go back.	0
  1607	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
  1608	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
  1609	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
  1610	Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
  1611	This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
  1612	did not like at all.	0
  1613	The Burrittos Blah!	0
  1614	- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
  1615	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
  1616	The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
  1617	This was like the final blow!	0
  1618	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
  1619	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
  1620	Service sucks.	0
  1621	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
  1622	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
  1623	Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
  1624	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
  1625	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
  1626	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
  1627	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
  1628	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
  1629	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
  1630	We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
  1631	The service was meh.	0
  1632	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
  1633	I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
  1634	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
  1635	2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
  1636	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
  1637	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
  1638	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
  1639	The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
  1640	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
  1641	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
  1642	In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
  1643	Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
  1644	say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
  1645	We'll never go again.	0
  1646	It was not good.	0
  1647	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
  1648	At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
  1649	It was pretty gross!	0
  1650	I've had better atmosphere.	0
  1651	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
  1652	Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
  1653	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
  1654	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
  1655	Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
  1656	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
  1657	I wouldn't return.	0
  1658	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
  1659	The management is rude.	0
  1660	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
  1661	Don't do it!!!!	0
  1662	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
  1663	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
  1664	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
  1665	The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
  1666	The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
  1667	I give it 2 thumbs down	0
  1668	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
  1669	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
  1670	Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
  1671	Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
  1672	I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
  1673	Avoid at all cost!	0
  1674	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
  1675	I've never been treated so bad.	0
  1676	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
  1677	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
  1678	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
  1679	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
  1680	The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
  1681	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
  1682	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
  1683	It was probably dirt.	0
  1684	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
  1685	When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
  1686	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
  1687	The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
  1688	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
  1689	The warm beer didn't help.	0
  1690	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
  1691	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
  1692	Must have been an off night at this place.	0
  1693	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
  1694	For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
  1695	Won't go back.	0
  1696	Soggy and not good.	0
  1697	Which are small and not worth the price.	0
  1698	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
  1699	The service was a bit lacking.	0
  1700	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
  1701	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
  1702	It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
  1703	As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
  1704	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
  1705	Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
  1706	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
  1707	The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
  1708	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
  1709	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
  1710	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
  1711	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
  1712	like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
  1713	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
  1714	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
  1715	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
  1716	Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
  1717	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
  1718	very tough and very short on flavor!	0
  1719	I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
  1720	The service was not up to par, either.	0
  1721	For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
  1722	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
  1723	I think not again	0
  1724	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
  1725	Service stinks here!	0
  1726	I waited and waited.	0
  1727	This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
  1728	Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
  1729	We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
  1730	I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
  1731	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
  1732	Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
  1733	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
  1734	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
  1735	Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
  1736	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
  1737	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
  1738	Food was really boring.	0
  1739	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
  1740	Will never, ever go back.	0
  1741	As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
  1742	She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
  1743	Never going back.	0
  1744	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
  1745	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
  1746	The only downside is the service.	0
  1747	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
  1748	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
  1749	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
  1750	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
  1751	Everything was gross.	0
  1752	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
  1753	The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	0
  1754	There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
  1755	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
  1756	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
  1757	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
  1758	He was terrible!	0
  1759	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
  1760	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
  1761	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
  1762	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
  1763	I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
  1764	My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
  1765	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
  1766	They dropped more than the ball.	0
  1767	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
  1768	I took back my money and got outta there.	0
  1769	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
  1770	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
  1771	I won't be back.	0
  1772	The food was terrible.	0
  1773	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
  1774	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
  1775	This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
  1776	This is a disgrace.	0
  1777	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
  1778	This one is simply a disappointment.	0
  1779	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
  1780	I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
  1781	Left very frustrated.	0
  1782	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
  1783	For service, I give them no stars.	0
  1784	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
  1785	Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
  1786	But now I was completely grossed out.	0
  1787	On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
  1788	Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
  1789	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
  1790	What a mistake that was!	0
  1791	Waiter was a jerk.	0
  1792	Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
  1793	I never come again.	0
  1794	Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
  1795	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0

  1802	I was so insulted.	0
  1803	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
  1804	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
  1805	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
  1806	The manager was the worst.	0
  1807	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
  1808	This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
  1809	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
  1810	Don't waste your time here.	0
  1811	Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
  1812	Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
  1813	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
  1814	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
  1815	The selection of food was not the best.	0
  1816	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
  1817	It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
  1818	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
  1819	And then tragedy struck.	0
  1820	I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
  1821	I would not recommend this place.	0

  1828	A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
  1829	first time there and might just be the last.	0
  1830	Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
  1831	And it was way to expensive.	0
  1832	Terrible management.	0
  1833	If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
  1834	Worst martini ever!	0
  1835	We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
  1836	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
  1837	No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
  1838	not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
  1839	The desserts were a bit strange.	0
  1840	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
  1841	However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
  1842	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
  1843	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
  1844	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
  1845	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
  1846	After two I felt disgusting.	0
  1847	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
  1848	The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
  1849	AN HOUR... seriously?	0
  1850	I consider this theft.	0
  1851	Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
  1852	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
  1853	Waited and waited and waited.	0
  1854	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
  1855	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
  1856	Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
  1857	Over rated.	0
  1858	If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
  1859	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
  1860	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
  1861	The kids play area is NASTY!	0
  1862	It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
  1863	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
  1864	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
  1865	Not good for the money.	0
  1866	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
  1867	I just wanted to leave.	0
  1868	I will not be eating there again.	0
  1869	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
  1870	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0

  1872	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
  1873	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
  1874	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
  1875	I will not return.	0
  1876	I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
  1877	Very disappointing!!!	0
  1878	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
  1879	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
  1880	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
  1881	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
  1882	Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
  1883	Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
  1884	Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
  1885	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
  1886	I'm not eating here!	0
  1887	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
  1888	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
  1889	Very bad Experience!	0

  1899	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
  1900	Service was slow and not attentive.	0
  1901	Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
  1902	Total brunch fail.	0
  1903	I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
  1904	Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
  1905	We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
  1906	I was mortified.	0
  1907	Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
  1908	Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
  1909	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
  1910	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
  1911	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0

  1914	Not my thing.	0
  1915	If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
  1916	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
  1917	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
  1918	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
  1919	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
  1920	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
  1921	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
  1922	Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
  1923	It was way over fried.	0
  1924	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
  1925	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
  1926	Will not be back!	0
  1927	I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
  1928	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
  1929	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
  1930	The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
  1931	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
  1932	The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0

  1934	Tasted like dirt.	0
  1935	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
  1936	the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0
  1937	What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
  1938	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
  1939	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
  1940	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
  1941	Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
  1942	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
  1943	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
  1944	We will not be coming back.	0
  1945	Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
  1946	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
  1947	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
  1948	Mediocre food.	0
  1949	I'm super pissd.	0
  1950	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
  1951	I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
  1952	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
  1953	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
  1954	The service was terrible though.	0

  1965	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
  1966	The service here is fair at best.	0
  1967	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
  1968	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
  1969	Very poor service.	0
  1970	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
  1971	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
  1972	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
  1973	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
  1974	for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
  1975	I won't be back.	0
  1976	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
  1977	This place deserves no stars.	0
  1978	I would not recommend this place.	0
  1979	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
  1980	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
  1981	I probably would not go here again.	0
  1982	The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
  1983	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
  1984	I probably won't be coming back here.	0
  1985	Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
  1986	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
  1987	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
  1988	I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
  1989	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
  1990	Weird vibe from owners.	0
  1991	There was hardly any meat.	0

  1994	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
  1995	The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
  1996	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
  1997	On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
  1998	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
  1999	The service was extremely slow.	0
  2000	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0

  2016	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
  2017	Overall, I like this place a lot.	1

  2024	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
  2025	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
  2026	My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1

  2053	Food arrived quickly!	1
  2054	On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
  2055	Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
  2056	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
  2057	Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
  2058	I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1

  2071	We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1

  2078	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
  2079	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
  2080	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
  2081	Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1

  2094	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
  2095	Bacon is hella salty.	1
  2096	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
  2097	The waitresses are very friendly.	1
  2098	Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
  2099	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
  2100	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
  2101	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1

  2103	I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1

  2128	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
  2129	Very very fun chef.	1
  2130	Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
  2131	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
  2132	Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
  2133	Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
  2134	Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
  2135	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
