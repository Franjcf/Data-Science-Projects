   119	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.	1

   151	I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	1
   152	Best headset ever!!!.	1
   153	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	1
   154	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1
   155	Excellent product for the price.	1
   156	It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1

   159	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
   160	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1
   161	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
   162	I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	1
   163	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	1

   171	Works good.	1
   172	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1
   173	but it is great, i would really recommend it	1
   174	You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."	1
   175	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
   176	Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.	1
   177	I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
   178	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
   179	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	1
   180	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	1
   181	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	1
   182	Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	1
   183	nice leather.	1
   184	It is a joy to use.	1
   185	Very satisifed with that.	1
   186	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	1
   187	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
   188	Love it.. Great armband.	1
   189	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
   190	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	1
   191	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	1
   192	Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1
   193	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	1
   194	It's pretty easy.	1
   195	Beautiful styling though.	1
   196	Excellent product.	1
   197	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1
   198	SWEETEST PHONE!!!	1
   199	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	1
   200	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	1
   201	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  	0
   202	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	0
   203	What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0
   204	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0
   205	This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
   206	And it was boring.  	0
   207	I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	0
   208	Why was this film made?  	0
   209	The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  	0
   210	The result is a film that just don't look right.  	0
   211	None of them are engaging or exciting.  	0
   212	The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  	0
   213	The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	0
   214	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0
   215	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
   216	Avoid at ALL costs!  	0
   217	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
   218	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0
   219	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0
   220	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
   221	The worst one of the series.  	0
   222	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
   223	It's very slow.  	0
   224	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0
   225	) Don't waste your time.  	0
   226	End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0
   227	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0
   228	This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  	0
   229	I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	0
   230	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
   231	Lots of holes in the script.  	0
   232	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
   233	Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
   234	The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
   235	The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
   236	Everything stinks.  	0
   237	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
   238	Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
   239	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
   240	In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
   241	Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
   242	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
   243	Either way, it sucks.  	0
   244	The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
   245	The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
   246	Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
   247	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
   248	Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
   249	You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
   250	Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
   251	He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
   252	I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
   253	The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
   254	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
   255	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
   256	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
   257	Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
   258	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
   259	Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
   260	I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
   261	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
   262	Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
   263	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
   264	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
   265	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
   266	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
   267	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
   268	Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  	0
   269	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
   270	As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	0
   271	I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
   272	One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0
   273	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0
   274	Hated it.  	0
   275	This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0
   276	I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	0
   277	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0
   278	This is not movie-making.  	0
   279	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0
   280	So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0
   281	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	0
   282	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0
   283	The story line is totally predictable.  	0
   284	I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  	0
   285	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0
   286	Really awful.  	0
   287	Not easy to watch.  	0
   288	Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	0
   289	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	0
   290	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0
   291	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	0
   292	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
   293	If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	0
   294	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
   295	I never walked out of a movie faster.  	0
   296	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0
   297	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
   298	In a word, it is embarrassing.  	0
   299	Exceptionally bad!  	0
   300	All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	0
   301	Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
   302	It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	1
   303	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	1
   304	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
   305	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	1
   306	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
   307	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
   308	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
   309	Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  	1
   310	See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	1
   311	See both films if you can.  	1
   312	It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.  	1
   313	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1
   314	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1
   315	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1
   316	" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
   317	Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
   318	Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
   319	I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
   320	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
   321	If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
   322	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
   323	A film not easily forgotten.  	1
   324	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
   325	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
   326	The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
   327	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
   328	Great movie!  	1
   329	Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
   330	She's poised and amazing.  	1
   331	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
   332	The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  	1
   333	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1
   334	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
   335	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
   336	I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1
   337	Excellent short film.  	1
   338	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
   339	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
   340	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
   341	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
   342	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1
   343	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
   344	I rate this movie 9/10.  	1
   345	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
   346	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1
   347	Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
   348	For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	1
   349	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
   350	The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	1
   351	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
   352	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1
   353	The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1
   354	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1
   355	People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	1
   356	This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
   357	Go rent it.  	1
   358	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1
   359	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
   360	Brilliance indeed.  	1
   361	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
   362	Think of the film being like a dream.  	1
   363	Simply beautiful.  	1
   364	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	1
   365	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
   366	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
   367	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
   368	It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  	1
   369	I enjoyed it.  	1
   370	I have recommended it to friends.  	1
   371	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1
   372	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
   373	Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	1
   374	The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	1
   375	The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	1
   376	The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1
   377	Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
   378	Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1
   379	Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  	1
   380	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
   381	Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1
   382	The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1
   383	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
   384	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1
   385	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
   386	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
   387	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1
   388	I keep watching it over and over.  	1
   389	It's a sad movie, but very good.  	1
   390	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
   391	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1
   392	Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
   393	;) Recommend with confidence!  	1
   394	This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	1
   395	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1
   396	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
   397	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
   398	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1
   399	Lange had become a great actress.  	1
   400	It looked like a wonderful story.  	1
   401	No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
   402	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
   403	Worst Thai ever.	0
   404	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
   405	Spend your money elsewhere.	0
   406	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
   407	And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
   408	-My order was not correct.	0
   409	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
   410	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
   411	We won't be returning.	0
   412	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
   413	Very, very sad.	0
   414	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
   415	How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
   416	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
   417	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
   418	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
   419	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
   420	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0
   421	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
   422	Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
   423	This place is disgusting!	0
   424	The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
   425	However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
   426	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
   427	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
   428	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
   429	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
   430	Disappointing experience.	0
   431	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
   432	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
   433	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0
   434	We won't be going back.	0
   435	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
   436	This place lacked style!!	0
   437	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
   438	Don't bother coming here.	0
   439	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
   440	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
   441	It was equally awful.	0
   442	Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
   443	very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
   444	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
   445	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
   446	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
   447	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
   448	I was VERY disappointed!!	0
   449	This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
   450	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
   451	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
   452	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
   453	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
   454	Con: spotty service.	0
   455	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
   456	But then they came back cold.	0
   457	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
   458	The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
   459	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
   460	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
   461	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
   462	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
   463	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
   464	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
   465	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
   466	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
   467	But I don't like it.	0
   468	Hell no will I go back	0
   469	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
   470	I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
   471	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
   472	The ambiance isn't much better.	0
   473	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
   474	The food wasn't good.	0
   475	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
   476	What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
   477	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
   478	Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
   479	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
   480	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
   481	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
   482	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
   483	Food was below average.	0
   484	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
   485	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
   486	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
   487	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
   488	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
   489	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
   490	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
   491	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
   492	Spend your money and time some place else.	0
   493	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
   494	the presentation of the food was awful.	0
   495	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
   496	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
   497	Appetite instantly gone.	0
   498	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
   499	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
   500	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
   501	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
   502	They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
   503	After one bite, I was hooked.	1
   504	Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
   505	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
   506	The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
   507	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
   508	Awesome selection of beer.	1
   509	Great food and awesome service!	1
   510	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
   511	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
   512	As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
   513	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
   514	Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
   515	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
   516	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
   517	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1
   518	Never had anything to complain about here.	1
   519	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
   520	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
   521	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
   522	I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
   523	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
   524	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
   525	The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
   526	Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
   527	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
   528	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
   529	This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
   530	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
   531	Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1

   533	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
   534	The block was amazing.	1
   535	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
   536	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
   537	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
   538	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
   539	These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
   540	I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
   541	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
   542	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
   543	The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
   544	I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
   545	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
   546	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
   547	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
   548	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
   549	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
   550	The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1

   553	And service was super friendly.	1
   554	This place was such a nice surprise!	1
   555	They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
   556	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1

   558	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
   559	I love this place.	1
   560	I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
   561	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
   562	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
   563	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
   564	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
   565	They were excellent.	1
   566	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
   567	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
   568	The food came out at a good pace.	1
   569	I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
   570	In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
   571	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
   572	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
   573	The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
   574	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1

   576	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1
   577	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1

   581	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
   582	For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1
   583	The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
   584	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
   585	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
   586	Go To Place for Gyros.	1
   587	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
   588	We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
   589	Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
   590	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
   591	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
   592	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
   593	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
   594	The pizza selections are good.	1
   595	I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1

   598	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
   599	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
   600	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
