The attached "DataAnalysisScript.py" script should be run within the "BestWords*" directory (and all the files within it). This directory contains the vocabulary and bag of words representations obtained from feature selection as explained in the report. 

The bag of words representation of the testing data was obtained by modifying the prepossessing script (saved as preprocesingTest.py). However, there is no need to use it since I have already generated all the vocabulary files.

The output of the script file includes an exploratory graph, several ROC graphs, performance reports, and performance graphs for each classifier.
